{"name":"Moon-orbits-earth","tagline":"(not to scale) (math is hard)","body":"### We simulated the apocalypse.\r\nFor a project in 8.012 (the masochist's version of introductory mechanics at MIT) I wrote a processing applet that shows two moons orbiting the Earth.  One \"moon\", the green one, is our usual garden-variety not-so-deadly moon.  It's orbiting in a more or less circular path around the Earth (none of this is really to scale). \r\n\r\nWe then imagined what would happen if an unrealistically supermassive asteroid collided with the moon and pushed it closer to the Earth.  This would push the moon into a very eccentric elliptical orbit; at the closest point it would be about twice as close to the Earth as the moon usually is, and at its farthest point it would be as far as the moon usually is.  \r\n\r\nBased on some very fudge-y mathematics, we figured out the approximate relative heights of the Earth's tidal bulge and indicated them as blue melon slices on the Earth.  The light/dark division on the moons and the Earth represent day and night sides, respectively.  \r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge of this project was figuring out how to express complicated mathematics computationally, then translate them as accurately and as legibly as possible. Given the large (actually astronomical) distances involved when we're talking about astronomy, displaying visible planets on a computer screen required egregious abuse of scale; however, the relevant timing of orbits and tidal bulges were well preserved.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
